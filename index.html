                <p>Hello, my name is Mitchell Spenski and I am an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer! I graduated from East Carolina University in the summer of 2016 with a B.S. in Health Services Management, and a minor in Business Administration. After graduating from college, I eventually landed a job as an Account Executive with a staffing agency that focused on the IT & Engineering industries. Over my time there, I began to understand the massive scope of the IT industry and learned all about the different positions and what their functions were. It was then that I realized what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to fully immerse myself in the world of Information Technology. </p>

                <p>After moving to Charlotte, I really started to drill down on what specifically I wanted to do for a career. After months of evaluating the myriad of options available, II settled on the 12 week UNCC Coding Bootcamp.</p>

                <p>During my short tenure in web development and coding, I have come to truly enjoy both the Front End and Back End. However, I have also realized that my strength is in the Back End. While I am extremely comfortable with Front End technologies, I don’t have the “eye for design” like a lot of others. My brain has always been more geared towards logic and numbers as opposed to design and creativity.</p>
